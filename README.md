# Esvelo Token Accelerator

## Overview
Esvelo Token Accelerator is a groundbreaking project focused on revolutionizing the token launch process on Uniswap. Our proprietary smart contracts are designed to facilitate an equitable and efficient distribution of tokens, ensuring a fair launch free from the influence of bots and whales.

### Key Features
- **Proprietary Uniswap Launch Contracts:** Customized smart contracts tailored for launching tokens on Uniswap.
- **Allowlist-Based Pooling:** Secure pooling of ETH from members before the launch, ensuring participation is reserved for allowlist participants.
- **Simultaneous Purchase and Launch:** All pooled ETH is used to purchase tokens for allowlist participants in the same transaction as the Uniswap launch.
- **Perfect Token Distribution:** Aimed at fostering growth by avoiding early monopolization of the tokens by bots and whales.

## Version 2: Risk-Free Token Accelerator
Building on our successful initial approach, Version 2 introduces enhanced features leveraging Uniswap V3's concentrated liquidity and our proprietary algorithms.

### Upcoming Features
- **Guaranteed Value for Investors:** Ensure that allowlist participants can sell their tokens at least at the value they bought them.
- **Leveraging Uniswap V3 Liquidity:** Utilizing concentrated liquidity to provide better investment security.
- **Secure Investments for Whitelist Investors:** Our smart contracts are designed to guarantee that investors can always sell their tokens at or above their invested capital level.
- **Liquidity Management:** Advanced management of liquidity to prevent pulling, ensuring a stable and secure environment for token launches.
